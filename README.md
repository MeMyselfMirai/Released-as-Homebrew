# Released as Homebrew

## Description
Recreating every released Blood on the Clocktower character in homebrew format. This will allow script-builders to recreate these characters to make changes to them such as custom jinxes, allowing duplicates tokens, ability modifications, or other changes that might match a Bootlegger modification.

This will attempt to fully match the released versions of characters without any modifications. Note that a homebrew character cannot use the exact id of a released character without being overridden within the app, so "_rah" is appended to each character id.

## BOTC Online App Compatibility
**3.47.4 - No more hidden votes**

## Git Expectations
* Tags are SemVer with no message. Release descriptions match the changelog.
* Commits are required to be squashed and submitted via pull-request.
* One character updated per pull-request, unless it is an app compatilibity update.
* If the character appears on a released script, include the change on that script as well.
* Update the README changelog and character lists.

### Character Testing
* For new unfinished characters, test by adding the homebrew recreation using the Released.json. This will insure that night order and jinxes are consistent.
