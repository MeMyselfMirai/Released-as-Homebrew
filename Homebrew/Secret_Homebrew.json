If a super crab nominates a regular crab, that player instantly dies and loses their ghost vote. If a super crab nominates another super crab, both super crabs must engage in roshambo until one player wins. The winning player remains a super crab while the loser reverts back to a regular crab and is ashamed. Each night a crab player may swap seats with an alive neighbour. Each night also pick another player. They receive the grimoire except only 1 role is correct. You are \"Mad\" that crabs are awesome or you may die. If a player is \"Mad\" that crabs suck and they neighbour a crab, they may instantly die and lose their dead vote and be asked to leave the room. Each night, pick a player, they die but register as alive. Start knowing any players who received a number 1. Also start by choosing 2 players, they start off as crabs. Crab players lose their previous character ability but are super cool. If a player is executed then during the night they receive an \"L\". During each day, a good player must be \"Mad\" that they worship the crab overlord otherwise may evil win the game. If a player is \"Mad\" that they do not understand how the Big Barnacle's ability works, they may die but cannot leave the game [-Other demons on the script.]",
